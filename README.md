# School-Dietary-Impact-on-Education
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2021), almost all students
from the United Kingdom attend school for 6 hours a day and take almost half of their daily
calories at school (para. 1). The food that they consume during school time may affect their
performance in academics. Teachers and parents might be interested in this topic as they play an
important part in creating a nutrition environment that supports studentsâ€™ healthy lifestyle.
Nadeem Arshad et al. (2014) stated that there is a correlation between food consumption and
academics. Students who skipped their breakfast, lunch and dinner due to being busy or having
lots of commitments will feel lazy and apathy during class and studying (p. 750). Based on the
statement, our group will analyze the impact of school dietary on education.
